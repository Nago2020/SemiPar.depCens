\usage{
SolveL(
  theta,
  resData,
  X,
  W,
  cop = c("Frank", "Gumbel", "Normal"),
  dist = c("Weibull", "lognormal")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{Estimated parameter values/initial values for finite dimensional parameters}

\item{resData}{Data matrix with three columns;  Z = the observed survival time, d1 = the censoring indicator of T
and  d2 =  the censoring indicator of C.}

\item{X}{Data matrix with covariates related to T}

\item{W}{Data matrix with covariates related to C. First column of W should be ones}

\item{cop}{Which copula should be computed to account for dependency between T and C. This argument can take
one of the values from \code{c("Gumbel", "Frank", "Normal")}. The default copula model is "Frank".}

\item{dist}{The distribution to  be used for the dependent censoring C. Only two distributions are allowed, i.e, Weibull
and lognormal distributions. With the value \code{"Weibull"} as the
default.}
}
\description{
This function estimates the cumulative hazard function of survival time (T) under dependent censoring (C). The estimation
makes use of the estimating equations derived based on martingale ideas.
