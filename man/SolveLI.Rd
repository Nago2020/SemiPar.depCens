\title{Cumulative hazard function of survival time under independent censoring}
\usage{
SolveLI(theta, resData, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{Estimated parameter values/initial values for finite dimensional parameters}

\item{resData}{Data matrix with three columns;  Z = the observed survival time, d1 = the censoring indicator of T
and  d2 =  the censoring indicator of C.}

\item{X}{Data matrix with covariates related to T}
}
\description{
This function estimates the cumulative hazard function of survival time (T) under the assumption of independent censoring.
The estimating equation is derived based on martingale ideas.
